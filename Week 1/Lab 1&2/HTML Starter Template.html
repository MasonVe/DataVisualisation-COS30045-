	<h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
	<h2>Animal Medicines Australia</h2>

	<p> There has been a substantial boom in pet ownership, with an estimated 30.4 million pets across the country.<br>
	Nationally, 69% of households now own a pet, up from 60% only two years ago.<br>
	This has been led by a surge in dog ownership - with over a million additional dogs being brought into Australian households since 2019.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A fifth (19%) of all pet dogs in Australia have been procured during the pandemic.</li>
		<li>A quarter (24%) of all pet cats in the country were also obtained during the pandemic.</li>
		<li>On average, pet owners are spending $3,200 per dog and $2,100 per cat each year.</li>
		<li>This is primarily on food, veterinary services, and healthcare.</li>
	</ul>
